Code refactoring...

This project was my first homework assignment while attending Northwestern's Full Stack Bootcamp. The assignment was the refactor the code and make the website accessible. 

First, I cleaned up the code and created more semantic HTML elements. I then fixed each of the links within the webpage and made sure they were working and accurate. I also condensed the CSS styling - this made the code much cleaner and removed the unnecessary styling. Finally, I went through the entire webpage and made sure it was accessible by confirming semantic HTML and adding alt tags where appropriate. In addition, I commented out each step to make sure others can understand exactly what each bit of code is doing.

The end result was a better functioning website, which was made accessible, and a cleaner code.

Some screenshots listed below...
